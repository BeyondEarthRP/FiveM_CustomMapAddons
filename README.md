# [YMAP] FiveM & GTA V Custom Map Addons by Human Tree92
I have will be creating & modifying this as needed. These are only to improve RP Experience within FiveM but i will include the XMLs for those that wish to use it for anything else. Current Map Addons:
+ Weigh Stations - 2 where used from https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/weigh-station-officerdeyoung.
+ Policing Dept Uprades - Adds Gates, Fences, & Lighting around Mission Row PD, Sandy Shores SD, & Paleto Bay SD.
+ Race Track - Race Track that i found online but edited it to fit for FiveM
+ LS Driving School - Found online ported to FiveM
+ Route 13 Barriers - Used for the Route 13 Traffic Lights. If someone runs into them they break & will no longer work. This solves that problem.

# How to install
The installation is rather quite simple.

1. Download the .zip or clone the repository to your desktop.
2. Extract the .zip to your desktop.
3. Create a Folder inside your Resources called custommapaddons.
4. Make a Resouces folder & put "this_is_a_map 'yes'" inside.
5. Make a Stream folder "stream" & place the ymaps inside here.
6. Then go to your server.cfg & under "AutoStartResources:" add the following
```lua
start custommapaddons
```
That's it. It's all installed & Thank you for using my Custom Map Addons
